            Front-End Development Internship
          </h2>
          <p className="text-justify max-w-lg text-sm mt-4 text-gray-200 leading-6 mx-auto">
            During my internship, I had the opportunity to work on various front-end development projects that helped me enhance my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I collaborated with a talented team of developers and gained valuable insights into real-world coding practices. I worked on building responsive websites, optimizing performance, and improving user experience.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify max-w-lg text-sm mt-4 text-gray-200 leading-6 mx-auto">
            One of the key highlights of my internship was contributing to a live project where I played a significant role in developing the front-end architecture.
          </p>

          <p className="text-justify max-w-lg text-sm mt-4 text-gray-200 leading-6 mx-auto">
            This internship not only honed my technical skills but also taught me the importance of teamwork, communication, and adapting to new technologies. I’m excited to apply the lessons I’ve learned in future projects and continue growing as a developer.
